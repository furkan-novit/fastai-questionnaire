# Questionnaire for Lesson 1

**Q: Do you need these for deep learning?**

- Lots of math
- Lots of data
- Lots of expensive computers
- A PhD

**A:** None of the above is necessary.


**Q: Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.**

**A:** NLP, Computer Vision, Image generation, Playing games, Medicine


**Q: What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?**

**A:** Mark 1 Perceptron


**Q: Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?**

**A:** Processing units -> State of activation

-> Output function -> Pattern of connectivity

-> Propagation rule -> Activation rule

-> Learning rule -> Environment


**Q: What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?**

**A:**
1. A single neural network cannot imitate an XOR function.
2. ?


**Q: What is a GPU?**

**A:** Graphics Processing Unit


**Q: Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?**

**A:** It outputs `2`.


**Q: Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.**

**Q: Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.**

**Q: Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?**

**A:** There is no straightforward way to describe the steps to the computer for this recognition process.


**Q: What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment"?**

**A:** An input's contribution to the output


**Q: What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?**

**A:** Parameters


**Q: Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.**

**A:** ![Samuel](./samuel.PNG)


**Q: Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?**

**A:** Again, its steps are not straightforward. It learns it weights by running through the training set multiple times and measuring its performance on the validation set.


**Q: What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?**

**A:** Universal approximation theorem


**Q: What do you need in order to train a model?**

**A:** Data


**Q: How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?**

**A:** Training the model based on previous arrest records predicts arrests rather than predicting actual crimes. Therefore, decisions based on this model might result in more arrests of certain groups of people, further leaning the model's predictions towards them.


**Q: Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?**

**A:** No, input images are resized automatically under the surface.


**Q: What is the difference between classification and regression?**

**A:** Classification's output is a group of classes, and the model predicts the class of an input. Regression, on the other hand, has a numeric output.


**Q: What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?**

**A:** A validation set is a set of data from the same pool as the training set. It is used to measure the success of the model on data that are not used in the training phase. A test set is also not used in the training phase. Its difference from the validation set is that it does not have to belong to the same pool as the training set. Also, it is not used to directly improve the model but mostly to evaluate it.

Not using these results in a blind model that only works well on the training set.


**Q: What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?**

**A:** It will use 20 percent of the training set as the validation set.
